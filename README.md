# Gradient_Ascent-Logistic_Regression-
Examples of Logistic Regression
The file 'Wea_Kol1.xlsx' contains data on Average Temperature, Average Humidity, and a categorical variable whether it rained on a given day, for 164 days for the city of Kolkata. A logistic regression model is fitted, first by using sm.logit and then by using gradient ascent, using 140 oservations as training data and 24 observations as test data. The results from using sm.logit are contained in 'Wea_For1.ipynb'. The results from using gradient ascent are contained in 'wea_for2.ipynb'.
