# Gradient_Ascent-Logistic_Regression-
Examples of Logistic Regression
The file 'Wea_Kol1.xlsx' contains data on Average Temperature, Average Humidity, and a binary variable whether it rained or not on a given day, for 164 days for the city of Kolkata. A logistic regression model is fitted, first by using sm.logit and then by using gradient ascent, using 140 oservations as training data and 24 observations as test data. The results from using sm.logit are contained in 'Wea_For1.ipynb'. From the estimated parameters, it can be said that the odds of it raining on a day with average temperature 25 degrees and average humidity 73% is 0.4643. From the gain chart it can be seen that the top 3 deciles contain 62% of the actual positives (days on which it rained). The results from using gradient ascent are contained in 'wea_for2.ipynb'.
